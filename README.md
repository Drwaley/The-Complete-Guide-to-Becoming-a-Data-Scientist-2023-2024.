3.2 Data Visualization

Data visualization tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn help you create meaningful graphs and charts. They enable you to visualize trends and patterns in your data. Here's an example of using Matplotlib to create a bar chart showing monthly sales:

```Python
Copy code
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

months = ['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar']
sales = [1000, 1200, 1500]

plt.bar(months, sales)
plt.xlabel('Months')
plt.ylabel('Sales')
plt.title('Monthly Sales')
plt.show()
```

3.3 Data Manipulation

Panda is a powerful library for data manipulation. You can use it to load, clean, and transform data. An example is reading a **CSV file** and displaying the first few rows:

```python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
print(data.head())
```

3.4 Machine Learning Libraries

Machine learning libraries like Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch facilitate building predictive models. For instance, **Scikit-Learn can be used for training a simple linear regression model:**

matrix_B = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]])

result = np.dot(matrix_A, matrix_B)
```

4.3 Calculus

Calculus plays a role in optimization algorithms used in machine learning. Derivatives and gradients are essential for understanding how models learn. Here's an example of finding the derivative of a function in Python:

```python
Copy code
import sympy as sp

x = sp.symbols('x')
function = x**2 + 3*x + 2
derivative = sp.diff(function, x)
```

4.4 Bayesian Statistics

Bayesian statistics is used to model uncertainty and update beliefs based on new evidence. Bayesian inference involves techniques like Bayes' theorem. For instance, you can use Bayesian methods for probabilistic programming in Python with libraries like PyMC3.

response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/data')
data = response.json()
```

5.2 Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Data often needs cleaning to handle missing values and outliers. Tools like Pandas are invaluable for this. For example, you can replace missing values with the mean:

```python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

data['column_name'].fillna(data['column_name'].mean(), inplace=True)
```

plt.ylabel('Y-axis')
plt.title('Scatter Plot')
plt.show()
```

6.2 Descriptive Statistics

Descriptive statistics summarize data. Compute measures like mean, median, and standard deviation using libraries like Pandas. For instance, you can find the mean of a dataset:

```python
Copy code
